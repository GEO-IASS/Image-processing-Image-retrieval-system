Covariance matrix run code:

1. Generalized eigenvalue distance
	a) In the Matlab Current Folder window add to path -> current folder in order to be able to run the feature_vector.m
	b) Run run_generalized_eigenvalues.m

2. Log - Euclidian distance 
	a) In the Matlab Current Folder window add to path -> current folder in order to be able to run the feature_vector.m
	b) Run run_log_euclidian.m
